<h3>About</h3>
This is a python/c framework for building and manipulating sound processing pipelines.
It is designed for real-time control.
It includes objects for oscillators, filters, file-io, soundcard and memory operations.
It is low-level: every byte counts.
Currently works on Linux and OSX.<br>

<h3>Tutorial</h3>
This is a brief tutorial covering the essentials of the python API.<br>
<a href="tutorial.py.html">tutorial.py</a> <br>

<h3>Reference</h3>
This lists all the hypersonic classes.<br>
<a href="Sonic.html">Sonic</a> <br>

<h3>Plugins</h3>
Writing your own plugins. Coming soon.

<h3>Downloads</h3>
Here it is.<br>
<a href="hypersonic-1.2.tar.gz">hypersonic-1.2.tar.gz</a><br>
<a href="hypersonic-1.0.2.tar.gz">hypersonic-1.0.2.tar.gz</a><br>
This is a binary for MacOSX 10.2.<br>
<a href="hypersonic-1.0.1.bin.OSX.tar.gz">hypersonic-1.0.1.bin.OSX.tar.gz</a><br>

<h3>Dependancies</h3>
python2.2<br>
debian: python-dev (rpm: python-devel)<br>
To compile on OSX you may need this and that developer tools.<br>

<h3>Todo</h3>
More documentation. Document c API, architecture.<br>
Distribute binaries.<br>
Release more scripts (there are many).<br>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
I'd like to know how you go with this, so I know what to do next.
Especially from anyone using OSX.

<h3>History</h3>
Work on this version began late in 2001.
It was initially intended to be a robust sound engine 
for my game prototype <a href="../axis-runner/index.html">Axis Runner</a>,
but it quickly grew out of control.<br>
I have used this code for real-time performance
and also studio-time compositions.<br>
The core has barely changed in the last 12 months; it works, it's tough.<br>

<h3>Music</h3>
Here are two excerpts from work I have done using this software.<br><br>
<a href="../../music/river_intro.mp3">The River (introduction)</a>(945K)<br>
This is from an improvisation.
I used the Linear task, acoustic feedback with DspRdWr,
/dev/midi from a keyboard and a simple (230 line) looping script.
All on a P133.<br><br>
<a href="../../music/happy.00.mp3">Happy (introduction)</a>(819K)<br>
This was improvised on an acoustic piano, and then I used fast fourier transform (libfftw, not implemented currently)
to choose and create extra Sin wave tones.
It was part of an experiment into algorithms to recognize pitch and melody.<br>
