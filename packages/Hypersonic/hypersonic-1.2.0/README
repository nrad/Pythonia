COMPILE
=======

% ./configure && make

For OSX fix sample.raw (already done in binary release):
% ./swab.py sample.raw sample.OSX.raw
% mv sample.OSX.raw sample.raw

If you want this to go (way) fast(er), at the risk of random unexplained
errors, stick a "-NDEBUG" on the end of the CFLAGS in the Makefile...

INSTALL
=======

% make install

(and make uninstall)

RUN
===

This will create/read a file ".hypersonicrc" in your home directory.
You can set some defaults there, buffer size and soundcard device.
